git commands

Here are some additional details about each command:

The git add command stages the changes to the file for commit. This means that the changes will be included in the next commit.
The git commit command commits the changes to your local repository. This creates a new commit object that contains the changes to the file.
The git push command pushes the changes to your remote repository. This updates the remote repository with the changes that you have made locally.

git add my_project.py
git commit -m "Added new line of code"
git push
